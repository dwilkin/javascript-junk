# Welcome to my JavaScript Playground!

### There's not much here right now, but I'll make an effort to update this README as I add content.  Don't expect anything spectacular, this will mostly be exercises.

### **Quiz**

The Quiz application is an exercise in using conditionals and loops to as a series of questions in the browser window with prompt boxes.  The questions and correct answers can be easily edited due to the architecture of the application, however it's important to note that if text is added as a possible answer (rather than numbers) then it's a good idea to also use the toUpperCase method on the answer when testing for accuracy.  Otherwise, any case changes in the answer submission will render it false.
